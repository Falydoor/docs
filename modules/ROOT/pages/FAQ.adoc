== What should I do if I find a bug?

Feel free to post a repo on the https://discord.gg/YJ7vheE[Discord channel] or if you are feeling ambitious file an https://github.com/stargate/docs/issues[issue] with steps for reproduction and we'll get to it as soon as possible.
Please remember to include a full stack trace (if any) and the versions of Stargate and Cassandra that you are using.

== Why should I use Stargate when I already have a Cassandra cluster?

Stargate provides APIs and data types that go beyond traditional CQL workloads. You can interact with your Cassandra cluster using REST or GraphQL, and let Stargate optimize the underlying queries and schema changes. Stargate simplifies access to your Cassandra data, while also expanding the ways you can interact with that data.
